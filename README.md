## Project Description
The Journey of creating this website called Headphones Hub started with extensive planning using FigJam for whiteboarding and Figma for the UI/UX design. Our database API endpoints were outlined by a ERD.

Roles
CJ-database/Api
SHAUN- HTML/CSS
FELIX-Javascript

Step 1:Whiteboarding
We started the project with a whiteboarding session in Figjam, planning out the API structure with the information the API would need. We used the session to also look at design layouts to get inspiration before going into Figma to build the design.

Step 2:UI/UX Design Figma
We designed the website in Figma, focusing on simple layout for easy customer engagement. The layout features a normal background, the company name, a navigation bar with home, product, and contact us. Product information is shown using a card-flip animation with name and price with a image of the product on the front and product description and features on the back of the card.
## Post-MVP Enhancements
Challenges
1.Github Group Collaboration: at the start our team faced issues with version control and code pulling/pushing. we quickly found the issues and change the way our workflow operated to prevent this from happening in the future.
2.Project planning:Reflecting back on our project's process, we found areas that we could have improved on in the planning process which would have helped me the project process smoother for everyone.

This Hackathon project was a great way to help the team learn how to plan, use Github for collaboration and to work as a team to fix issues throughout the process.
